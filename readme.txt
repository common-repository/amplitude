== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Amplitude also unites your web and product insights, giving you a holistic understanding of your end-to-end customer journey.

=Who should use the Amplitude for WordPress plugin?=

The Amplitude for WordPress plugin is perfect for small businesses and startups that want to connect their WordPress site to the industry-leading Digital Analytics Platform without engineering resources. Amplite empowers small teams to grow their business with ease.

If you miss GA’s Universal Analytics or GA 360, or if you want to move from GA4 to holistic web and product insights, the Amplitude for WordPress plugin is for you. This plugin enables  you to bridge the gap between your website and its performance by automatically sending real-time insights from WordPress to Amplitude.

=Can I use the Amplitude for WordPress plugin alongside Google Analytics?=

Yes, Amplitude is 100% compatible with Google Analytics. You’ll be able to see WordPress insights in both platforms, but Amplitude has self-serve access and is easier to use and understand. You may notice discrepancies between the data in [Amplitude vs. Google Analytics](https://amplitude.com/amplitude-vs-google-analytics), and that’s because Amplitude gathers your website and product data across the entire customer journey. In other words, you get more accurate insights from Amplitude than GA because we collect more data points.

=How does the Amplitude for WordPress plugin work?=

The Amplitude for WordPress plugin enables the seamless integration, onboarding, and instrumentation of WordPress data into Amplitude. The plugin installs a [Browser SDK](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/sdks/typescript-browser/), which automatically sends analytics event data from your WordPress site to Amplitude. The SDK also adds a [Browser SDK script](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@amplitude/analytics-browser) to each web page, enabling automatic Default Event Tracking on your website.

Your WordPress site is ready to run Web Experiments! You can visually edit, add custom code, or split traffic to different URLs out of the box. This enables you to analyze your web data and generate real-time web analytics right into your Amplitude dashboard. With the power of the Amplitude digital analytics platform, you get access to cohorts and can even learn what your customers are experiencing with Session Replay.

Your WordPress site will automatically send data about website events (such as page views, sessions, clicks, conversions, etc.) into Amplitude. This enables you to analyze your web data and generate real-time web insights right in your Amplitude dashboard. If the [Session Replay](https://amplitude.com/blog/introducing-session-replay) checkbox is checked, the plugin also installs and activates the Session Replay SDK with the [sampling rate](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/session-replay/sdks/plugin/#sampling-rate) you’ve selected.

=Where can I find my API key?=

You can find the unique API key that connects Amplitude to WordPress in the “Project Settings” in your Amplitude dashboard. This page has [detailed instructions on where to find your API key](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/analytics/find-api-credentials/).

=Can I easily track events on my WordPress website?=

Yes. Amplitude's Browser SDK captures page views, sessions, related event properties, and user properties out of the box by default. Visual tag editor adds the ability to capture element interactions and create events through a user interface, and it includes support for glob match to handle multiple pages. More information on the events and event properties captured through the SDK [can be found here](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/sdks/browser-2/#tracking-default-events) and information about our visual tag editor [can be found here](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/24094812669979-Create-dynamic-events-with-the-Visual-Tag-Editor).

=Do I need to do anything special if my Amplitude account is EU-based?=

Yes, select the “Set Server Zone to EU” checkbox in Amplitude settings and save.

- Page views
- Sessions
